  As someone who takes an unorthodox approach to software development, I wanted to share my thoughts on pull requests. While they can be helpful for having another developer review
  your code, I find the traditional approach to be a bit cumbersome and demotivating.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout my career, I have worked on many teams with varying company cultures around pull requests. However, I have noticed similar problems arise time and time again, such as
  developers not responding to pull requests in a timely manner, leaving the original author unable to commit their code. Additionally, I have seen pull requests get blocked over
  nitpicky issues or developers simply rubberstamping them to avoid a thorough review.
</p>

<p>
  In my experience, less than 5% of my pull requests actually surface fundamental bugs or issues in my code. Most issues are discovered during a QA phase or even after release to
  production. This makes me question whether the overhead of pull requests is worth the little impact they have.
</p>

<p>
  I have also noticed that many developers simply skim through the changes on GitHub without actually running the code. This approach often misses important things and renders the
  code review ineffective.
</p>

<p>
  Personally, I find pull requests to be more effective when required reviews are at the discretion of the developer. Pull requests are useful for new developers who need their
  work reviewed and for more complicated sections of code. However, for basic changes, waiting for a coworker to review your code can be demotivating and slow down overall
  progress.
</p>

<p>
  While shipping broken code is never ideal, I believe a stronger QA workflow is more important than pest-driven code reviews. Many development shops downplay the QA process,
  thinking that the pull request/code review process is enough. But if you're a smaller company with limited resources, sometimes you need to move fast and break things.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, I know that not everyone will agree with my relaxed standards for code review. However, I believe we could be entering an era where this is a moot point. With the rise
  of strong AI models, such as ChatGPT, someone is bound to be working on software to automate code reviews. An AI-driven model could review code better than any human and mitigate
  all the current problems caused by humans during a traditional code review process.
</p>

<p>
  Until that day comes, I will continue to advocate for a code review process that is less stringent, more at the discretion of the developer, and equally impactful as it is
  cumbersome.
