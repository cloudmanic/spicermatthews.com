<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  Here's a premise I'd put money on: anyone who can build a solid product—something genuinely useful and well-executed—can attract 100 customers. It's the leap from 100 to 1,000 where founders get crushed.
</p>

<p>
  I've started multiple SaaS products. I've helped build others. And every time, the pattern holds. The first 100 customers? Achievable. Beyond that? A grind that breaks most people.
</p>

<p>
  But lately I've been obsessed with a different question: <em>what if you didn't need 1,000 customers at all?</em>
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>The First 100 Customers Are the Easy Part</h2>

<p>
  Think about how founders get their first customers. They pull from their network. They tap into mailing lists they've been building for years. They generate early buzz on Twitter or LinkedIn. Friends tell friends. A few product hunt upvotes roll in.
</p>

<p>
  None of this is easy, exactly—but it's <em>doable</em>. You're operating within your circle of influence. People know you, trust you, or are curious enough to give you a shot.
</p>

<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r">
  <p class="text-blue-900 m-0">
    The first 100 customers come from momentum you've already built. They're the reward for showing up, shipping something real, and asking people to try it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  If you execute well, reaching 100 customers is less about marketing genius and more about competence plus persistence. It's table stakes for anyone serious about building something.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>Going from 100 to 1,000 Is Where Dreams Die</h2>

<p>
  Once you've exhausted your network, everything changes.
</p>

<p>
  Now you need complete strangers to find you, trust you, and pay you. That's a fundamentally different challenge. Your warm leads are gone. The early adopters who believed in you just because they knew you? They've already converted or passed.
</p>

<p>
  So you start buying ads. You begin obsessing over SEO. You spend nights on social media trying to drum up attention. And suddenly, every single customer feels ten times harder to acquire.
</p>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400">
  <p class="font-medium text-gray-800 m-0">The economics get brutal:</p>
  <ul class="text-gray-700 mt-2 mb-0">
    <li><strong>Paid ads</strong> — expensive, competitive, easy to burn cash with nothing to show</li>
    <li><strong>SEO</strong> — takes 6-12 months minimum to see real results</li>
    <li><strong>Content marketing</strong> — time-intensive, often thankless work</li>
    <li><strong>Customer acquisition cost</strong> — keeps climbing while lifetime value stays flat</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  I've watched founders—including myself—hit this wall. After 100 customers, you think you have momentum. You don't. You have proof of concept. The real work hasn't started yet.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>$200/Month Is Only "Expensive" in SaaS</h2>

<p>
  Here's what got me thinking differently about this problem.
</p>

<p>
  In the SaaS world, $200/month feels like a lot for consumer software. Most users won't flinch at $9/month or even $100/year. But push past that threshold and suddenly you're facing serious resistance. Sales cycles get longer. Objections multiply. Conversion rates tank.
</p>

<p>
  And yet—in the real world—middle-class families pay $200/month for things all the time without a second thought.
</p>

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-green-800 m-0">$200/month for drum lessons</p>
    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Once a week, half an hour. My daughter loves it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-green-800 m-0">$200/month for cell phones</p>
    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Family of four? That bill adds up fast.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-green-800 m-0">$200/month for cable and internet</p>
    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Bundled services we barely think about.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-green-800 m-0">$200/month for youth sports</p>
    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Travel leagues, equipment, tournament fees.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The difference isn't the price. It's the <em>context</em>. In the physical world, $200/month feels normal because there's tangible value—a teacher, a service, a product you can touch. In software, that same amount feels steep because we've been conditioned to expect digital products to be cheap or free.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>The Music School Model</h2>

<p>
  Let me walk through an example that crystallized this for me.
</p>

<p>
  My daughter takes drum lessons at a local music school. The teacher probably makes around $40,000 a year. Throw in maybe $100,000 for rent, utilities, admin staff, and other overhead. Total operating cost: roughly $140,000 annually.
</p>

<p>
  Now consider the revenue side.
</p>

<div class="bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="font-bold text-purple-800 m-0 text-xl">100 students × $200/month = $240,000/year</p>
  <p class="text-purple-700 m-0 mt-2">After $140k in expenses, that's <strong>$100,000 in profit</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>
  One hundred students. That's it. A single location with a handful of practice rooms and one or two instructors can generate six figures in profit for the owner.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't a venture-scale business. It's not going to make anyone a billionaire. But it's a <em>real</em> business with <em>real</em> profit—built on just 100 customers.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>AI Changed the Equation</h2>

<p>
  Here's where things get interesting for those of us who build software.
</p>

<p>
  AI has made building products dramatically faster and cheaper. What used to take months now takes weeks. What used to require a team can sometimes be done solo. I wrote about this in my piece on <a href="/blog/the-ai-side-hustle-revolution-turning-niche-ideas-into-income/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">the AI side hustle revolution</a>—building a functional SaaS product in under 80 hours is genuinely possible now.
</p>

<p>
  But there's a flip side. The internet is <em>flooded</em> with cheap SaaS tools. Competition is brutal. Every category has a dozen options, most of them racing to the bottom on price.
</p>

<p>
  If you're a solo founder trying to compete in that environment, you're fighting an uphill battle. You don't have the marketing budget to outspend competitors. You don't have the team to outship them.
</p>

<div class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="text-xl font-medium m-0">
    Your advantage as a solo founder isn't competing on price.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 m-0 mt-2">
    It's serving a specific audience so well that they're happy to pay premium prices.
  </p>
</div>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>Work Backwards from Your Income Goal</h2>

<p>
  Most founders start with a problem and work outward. Find a pain point, build a solution, figure out pricing later. That's a valid approach—maybe even the right one for most people.
</p>

<p>
  But I think there's value in starting from a different direction: <em>what do you actually want to earn?</em>
</p>

<p>
  Be honest with yourself. For a lot of people, the answer is something like: "If I could make $100,000 a year in profit, I'd have a sustainable, interesting business that lets me work on my own terms."
</p>

<p>
  Great. Now work backwards.
</p>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="font-bold text-gray-800 m-0 mb-3">The math is simple:</p>
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
    <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 m-0">$50k profit</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm m-0 mt-1">= 50 customers at $100/mo</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 m-0">$100k profit</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm m-0 mt-1">= 100 customers at $100/mo</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 m-0">$200k profit</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm m-0 mt-1">= 100 customers at $200/mo</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The higher your price, the fewer customers you need. And if you only need 100 customers—customers you can realistically reach through your existing network, a focused niche, and genuine expertise—suddenly the path looks a lot more achievable.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>The Question You Should Actually Be Asking</h2>

<p>
  Stop asking: "How do I get 1,000 customers?"
</p>

<p>
  Start asking: <strong>"What can I build that 100 people would pay $200/month for?"</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This reframes everything. You're not trying to win a volume game. You're not competing with venture-backed startups who can afford to lose money for years. You're building something valuable enough that a small, specific group of people will happily pay premium prices for it.
</p>

<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r">
  <p class="font-medium text-blue-900 m-0">
    That might mean marrying your technology background with real-world services. It might mean solving a problem for a niche so specific that big players ignore it. It might mean offering something with a human touch that scales less efficiently but commands higher prices.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The point is: the path to a sustainable business doesn't have to run through massive scale. For most solo founders, it probably shouldn't.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>

<p>
  We've been conditioned to chase scale. More users, more growth, more funding. But for independent founders, that playbook often leads to burnout, not success.
</p>

<p>
  The alternative is simpler than it sounds.
</p>

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-2 my-6">
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Find 100 people</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Charge $200/month</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Build a real business</div>
</div>

<p>
  One hundred customers is achievable. Two hundred dollars a month is reasonable—if the value is there. And $100k+ in annual profit is a life-changing outcome for most people.
</p>

<p>
  Stop optimizing for scale. Start optimizing for value.
</p>
