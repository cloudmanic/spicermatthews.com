<p>
  For the past two decades, I've been what you might call a hobbyist builder. Every year, I take on one major construction project—sometimes a new build, sometimes a big
  renovation. Some are investment properties, others personal. These days, I've been buried in projects around my own home, but trust me—this isn't some HGTV fantasy land. It's
  more "sweat equity and YouTube tutorials" than "dream home reveal."
</p>

<p>
  Still, after years of hauling lumber and learning lessons the hard way, the place has started to look... decent. Maybe even a little too decent. And that's where things get
  tricky.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm seeking bids for my own projects—drywall, electrical, whatever—I don't just hit up the same handful of subs. I cast a wide net. One, to get a sense of what's fair. Two,
  to keep my usual folks honest. (No offense if you're reading this, guys.) But over time, I noticed a strange pattern: some quotes came back looking like someone thought I'd just
  won the lottery.
</p>

<p>
  It turns out that if your property <em>looks</em> even remotely put-together, some people assume you're made of money. Suddenly, a straightforward job gets the "deluxe pricing
  package." That's when I started playing a little defense.
</p>

<p>
  I'd show up in my paint-covered work boots. I'd drop casual hints about past projects—"Yeah, I just wrapped up framing a duplex last fall…"—stuff like that. Just enough to let
  them know: I know my way around a project timeline and a tape measure. And wouldn't you know it? The bids started coming back a whole lot more reasonable.
</p>

<p>
  Want to know the ultimate red flag? It's when a contractor starts getting a little too curious about your personal life. "So, what do you do for a living?" or "Did you just buy
  this place?" It might sound friendly, but it's often a sneaky way of sizing you up. I've literally had quotes drop by half after saying, "Hey, you're about double what the market
  is." That kind of sudden discount doesn't scream "fair pricing" to me.
</p>

<p>
  Look, I'm not trying to throw shade at all contractors. Plenty of them are honest, hardworking folks. I respect the craft. But I've been around long enough to tell when the price
  is for the job—and when it's for the assumed lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
  So if you're lining up work on your place, here's my two cents: get multiple bids. Ask questions. Wear your rattiest hoodie if you have to. You don't need to be a general
  contractor to protect your budget—you just need to look like you've been to a job site or two.
</p>

<p>
  And for the pros out there: don't size people up. Seriously. Just quote the work based on the work. Most of us just want things done right, on time, and at a fair price. You do
  that, and I promise—you'll stand out.
</p>

<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go sand something. Or find where I left my level. Again.</p>
