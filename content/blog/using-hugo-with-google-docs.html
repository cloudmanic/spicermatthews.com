<blockquote><b>Quick tip alert!</b> This is how I import Google docs into Hugo.</blockquote>

<p>I am becoming a big fan of <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> to
	build static sites like <a href="https://spicermatthews.com">this one</a> and <a href="https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com">this one</a>.
	Since Hugo does not ship with any fancy GUI as other content management systems do -- typically you
	produce your content within your text editor such as <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>.</p>

<p>Text editors are great but they are not ideal for producing well-thought-out written content. I like to produce my content in Google docs and then import it into Hugo. Below is a video showing how I do it. The basic
	steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Write your post within Google docs. Adding any basic formatting you want. </li>
	<li>Export the document to HTML (File -&gt; Download as -&gt; Web page).</li>
	<li>Open the HTML in your text editor and copy the content of the body.</li>
	<li>Visit <a href="https://imperavi.com/redactor">https://imperavi.com/redactor</a> and
		clear the content of the sample editor on the home page.</li>
	<li>Copy your HTML body into the editor. Then click view source. You now have clean HTML.</li>
	<li>Copy the clean HTML into your Hugo post and make any tweaks you need. </li>
</ol>
