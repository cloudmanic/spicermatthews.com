<p>In early 2023, <a href="https://www.payrent.com/articles/2023-oregon-eviction-laws/">Oregon updated its rental laws</a>, significantly complicating the eviction process for landlords dealing with tenants who fell behind on rent. As a property owner myself, this translated into hours lost each month manually handling and serving past-due rent notices. It was monotonous, repetitive, and eating away at my evenings and weekends. Clearly, a software solution was needed—but given my demanding day job, the time investment felt prohibitive. Until I discovered the power of AI.</p>

<p>I challenged myself: could I build an entire, functional product—fully launched and customer-ready—with no more than 80 hours of focused work and a maximum budget of $1000? The result was <a href="https://oregonpastduerent.com">OregonPastDueRent.com</a>, a niche product designed specifically to automate the generation and delivery of legally compliant past-due rent notices for Oregon landlords.</p>

<h2>AI-Powered Development: From Weeks to Hours</h2>

<p>Leveraging AI-driven tools like <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, and <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>, I dramatically accelerated the development process. Tasks that typically would have taken weeks of coding and debugging were condensed into mere hours. AI handled much of the routine coding, allowing me to operate in a "vibe coding" style—focusing more on managing and refining outputs rather than writing every line myself.</p>

<p>Without these tools, creating OregonPastDueRent.com in my spare time would have realistically required six months to a year. Even then, the niche nature of the project might have led me to abandon it entirely due to perceived limited revenue potential. Historically, I had set a mental barrier: any project needed the potential to generate at least $100,000 annually to be worth pursuing. But AI has fundamentally changed that calculus.</p>

<h2>The Economics of Niche Software in the AI Era</h2>

<p>Now, even extremely niche products can be worthwhile. If OregonPastDueRent.com generates just $10,000 annually, it's unquestionably valuable. For less than two weeks of total working hours and minimal upfront investment, I've created a sustainable, revenue-generating side business.</p>

<p>This experience taught me something crucial: in the AI-powered era, niche software ideas become feasible and economically practical. We no longer need to dismiss smaller ideas as "not worth it." Instead, with limited effort and resources, we can experiment, launch, and quickly validate concepts. Each idea, however niche, can be its own profitable micro-business or rewarding side hustle.</p>

<h2>From Employee to Entrepreneur: The Developer's New Path</h2>

<p>As software developers, we're rightfully concerned about <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-jobs-are-affected-by-ai-better-paid-better-educated-workers-face-the-most-exposure/">AI replacing jobs</a>, particularly junior-level roles or less dynamic positions. But there's a silver lining. AI can empower motivated developers to quickly launch niche businesses and diversify income streams.</p>

<p>Just as many individuals found freedom and success transitioning from traditional W2 jobs into entrepreneurship through the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy">gig economy</a>, software developers now have a similar, perhaps even greater, opportunity with AI. Rather than turning to driving <a href="https://www.uber.com/driving/">Uber</a> or managing an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes">Airbnb</a>, developers can harness AI tools to rapidly build niche businesses, fundamentally changing their career trajectory from employees to empowered entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>The Opportunity Ahead</h2>

<p>For those developers proactive enough to embrace this change, AI isn't a threat—it's an unprecedented opportunity. <a href="https://oregonpastduerent.com">OregonPastDueRent.com</a> is just one example. It's proof that in the age of AI, "too niche" is no longer a barrier but an invitation to innovation.</p>

<p>The tools are here. The barrier to entry has never been lower. The question isn't whether AI will change how we work—it's whether you'll use it to build your own path to financial independence. Start small, think niche, and let AI handle the heavy lifting while you focus on solving real problems for real people.</p>

<p>What niche problem could you solve in 80 hours? The answer might be your next successful side hustle.</p>
