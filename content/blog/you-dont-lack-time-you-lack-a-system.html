<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  I came across a quote from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseitzler/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Jesse Itzler</a> recently that stuck with me more than I expected:
</p>

<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r">
  <p class="text-xl font-medium text-blue-900 m-0 italic">
    "You don't lack time. You lack a system."
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm text-blue-700 m-0 mt-2">
    — Jesse Itzler
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  At first, it sounded obvious—almost too neat. But the more I sat with it, the more I realized why it bothered me. Not because it was wrong, but because it described how I've been living for years without ever quite putting words to it.
</p>

<h2>I Stopped Answering the Phone</h2>

<p>
  One of the earliest examples goes back to a decision I made a long time ago: I stopped answering the phone.
</p>

<p>
  Not in a dramatic way. I didn't announce it or make a big deal out of it. I just noticed that phone calls were quietly consuming far more time than they deserved. I remember looking at my voicemails one day and doing a bit of back-of-the-napkin math.
</p>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400">
  <p class="font-medium text-gray-800 m-0">
    If each callback took about ten minutes—and most of them did—that added up to roughly <strong>four full days</strong> of my year spent returning calls.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 m-0 mt-2 text-sm">
    Four days of pleasantries, context switching, and winding conversations before getting to whatever the actual point was.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  So I changed the system.
</p>

<p>
  My voicemail now says that if something is urgent, leave a message and I'll call back. Otherwise, text or email me to start the conversation. Most things don't actually require a live call. And when they do, we schedule one at a time that works for both of us.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 italic">
  Nothing about access changed. The outcomes didn't change. But my days got noticeably quieter and more focused.
</p>

<h2>The Rule: Don't Do It Twice</h2>

<p>
  Once I started noticing this pattern, I realized I was doing it in other parts of my life too.
</p>

<p>
  I've developed a personal rule over time:
</p>

<div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="text-lg text-green-800 font-semibold m-0">
    If I don't enjoy doing something and it's repetitive, I don't do it twice.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Laundry is the obvious example. I don't like doing laundry. It's not relaxing. It's not creative. It doesn't add anything meaningful to my life. So I outsource it.
</p>

<p>
  That decision isn't about convenience—it's about <em>attention</em>. I'm intentionally trading money for time and mental energy. And once you start thinking that way, you see opportunities everywhere.
</p>

<ul class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <li>Anything repetitive gets automated</li>
  <li>Anything uninteresting gets outsourced</li>
  <li>Anything unnecessary gets eliminated</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Over time, that creates a life where most of my effort is spent on things I actually care about.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>Even Small Things Matter</h2>

<p>
  I eat more Chick-fil-A than I probably should. The drive-through line is often long enough that I could sit in my car for twenty minutes just inching forward. Mobile ordering lets me skip the line and pull straight to the front.
</p>

<p>
  It sounds trivial, but it buys back twenty minutes.
</p>

<p>
  People tend to dismiss optimizations like that because they're "only" saving a little time. But that's missing the point.
</p>

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 my-6">
  <div class="flex-1 bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-purple-800 m-0">Compound Effect</p>
    <p class="text-purple-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Twenty minutes here, twenty minutes there—it adds up fast.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-1 bg-indigo-50 border border-indigo-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="font-bold text-indigo-800 m-0">Reduced Friction</p>
    <p class="text-indigo-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Less waiting. Less annoyance. Less mental drag.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>Intentional Structure</h2>

<p>
  That same thinking shows up in how I structure my days.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don't respond to emails constantly—I have specific times for it</li>
  <li>I don't answer text messages all day—I batch them</li>
  <li>I have a routine to start my day and a routine to end it</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By carving out time intentionally, everything else in between becomes more efficient. I'm not reacting all day long. <strong>I'm deciding when things happen.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This is inspired by ideas like <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Deep Work</a> from Cal Newport—the concept that focused, uninterrupted work is where real value gets created. Constant context-switching is the enemy of getting meaningful things done.
</p>

<hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

<h2>The Realization</h2>

<p>
  That's what that quote helped crystallize for me.
</p>

<p class="text-lg font-medium">
  I don't actually need more time. Most of us don't.
</p>

<p>
  What we need are systems that:
</p>

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-2 my-6">
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Protect our attention</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Reduce friction</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Compound over time</div>
</div>

<p>
  Small changes compound. Habits turn into structure. And structure quietly creates space—for focus, creativity, and the things that actually matter.
</p>

<div class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
  <p class="text-xl font-medium m-0">
    You don't lack time.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 m-0 mt-2 text-lg">
    You just lack a system.
  </p>
</div>
