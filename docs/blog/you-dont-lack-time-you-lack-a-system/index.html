<span class="hidden lg:inline font-light">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;---- I dare you!</span></div><div class="py-5 px-8"><h1 class=text-center>You Don't Lack Time. You Lack a System.</h1><p><b>Date:</b> Jan 13, 2026</p><div class=my-5><p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I came across a quote from <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseitzler/ class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Jesse Itzler</a> recently that stuck with me more than I expected:</p><div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r"><p class="text-xl font-medium text-blue-900 m-0 italic">"You don't lack time. You lack a system."</p><p class="text-sm text-blue-700 m-0 mt-2">— Jesse Itzler</p></div><p>At first, it sounded obvious—almost too neat. But the more I sat with it, the more I realized why it bothered me. Not because it was wrong, but because it described how I've been living for years without ever quite putting words to it.</p><hr class="my-8 border-gray-300"><h2>I Stopped Answering the Phone</h2><p>One of the earliest examples goes back to a decision I made a long time ago: I stopped answering the phone.</p><p>Not in a dramatic way. I didn't announce it or make a big deal out of it. I just noticed that phone calls were quietly consuming far more time than they deserved. I remember looking at my voicemails one day and doing a bit of back-of-the-napkin math.</p><div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400"><p class="font-medium text-gray-800 m-0">If each callback took about ten minutes—and most of them did—that added up to roughly <strong>four full days</strong> of my year spent returning calls.</p><p class="text-gray-600 m-0 mt-2 text-sm">Four days of pleasantries, context switching, and winding conversations before getting to whatever the actual point was.</p></div><p>So I changed the system.</p><p>My voicemail now says that if something is urgent, leave a message and I'll call back. Otherwise, text or email me to start the conversation. Most things don't actually require a live call. And when they do, we schedule one at a time that works for both of us.</p><p class="text-gray-600 italic">Nothing about access changed. The outcomes didn't change. But my days got noticeably quieter and more focused.</p><hr class="my-8 border-gray-300"><h2>The Rule: Don't Do It Twice</h2><p>Once I started noticing this pattern, I realized I was doing it in other parts of my life too.</p><p>I've developed a personal rule over time:</p><div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-6 rounded-lg my-6"><p class="text-lg text-green-800 font-semibold m-0">If I don't enjoy doing something and it's repetitive, I don't do it twice.</p></div><p>Laundry is the obvious example. I don't like doing laundry. It's not relaxing. It's not creative. It doesn't add anything meaningful to my life. So I outsource it.</p><p>That decision isn't about convenience—it's about <em>attention</em>. I'm intentionally trading money for time and mental energy. And once you start thinking that way, you see opportunities everywhere.</p><ul class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4"><li>Anything repetitive gets automated</li><li>Anything uninteresting gets outsourced</li><li>Anything unnecessary gets eliminated</li></ul><p>Over time, that creates a life where most of my effort is spent on things I actually care about.</p><hr class="my-8 border-gray-300"><h2>Even Small Things Matter</h2><p>I eat more Chick-fil-A than I probably should. The drive-through line is often long enough that I could sit in my car for twenty minutes just inching forward. Mobile ordering lets me skip the line and pull straight to the front.</p><p>It sounds trivial, but it buys back twenty minutes.</p><p>People tend to dismiss optimizations like that because they're "only" saving a little time. But that's missing the point.</p><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 my-6"><div class="flex-1 bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 p-4 rounded-lg"><p class="font-bold text-purple-800 m-0">Compound Effect</p><p class="text-purple-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Twenty minutes here, twenty minutes there—it adds up fast.</p></div><div class="flex-1 bg-indigo-50 border border-indigo-200 p-4 rounded-lg"><p class="font-bold text-indigo-800 m-0">Reduced Friction</p><p class="text-indigo-700 text-sm m-0 mt-1">Less waiting. Less annoyance. Less mental drag.</p></div></div><hr class="my-8 border-gray-300"><h2>Intentional Structure</h2><p>That same thinking shows up in how I structure my days.</p><ul><li>I don't respond to emails constantly—I have specific times for it</li><li>I don't answer text messages all day—I batch them</li><li>I have a routine to start my day and a routine to end it</li></ul><p>By carving out time intentionally, everything else in between becomes more efficient. I'm not reacting all day long. <strong>I'm deciding when things happen.</strong></p><p>This is inspired by ideas like <a href=https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/ class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Deep Work</a> from Cal Newport—the concept that focused, uninterrupted work is where real value gets created. Constant context-switching is the enemy of getting meaningful things done.</p><hr class="my-8 border-gray-300"><h2>The Realization</h2><p>That's what that quote helped crystallize for me.</p><p class="text-lg font-medium">I don't actually need more time. Most of us don't.</p><p>What we need are systems that:</p><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-2 my-6"><div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Protect our attention</div><div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Reduce friction</div><div class="bg-green-100 text-green-800 text-center py-3 px-3 rounded font-medium">Compound over time</div></div><p>Small changes compound. Habits turn into structure. And structure quietly creates space—for focus, creativity, and the things that actually matter.</p><div class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg my-8"><p class="text-xl font-medium m-0">You don't lack time.</p><p class="text-gray-300 m-0 mt-2 text-lg">You just lack a system.</p></div><div class="mt-8 mb-8"><h2 class=font-semibold>Did you enjoy this read?</h2><p class="font-sans font-normal">Help a brother out -- <a href=https://twitter.com/spicermatthews>follow me</a> on Twitter.</p></div><div class="bg-orange-200 px-1 py-1 md:px-10 md:py-5"><form action=https://sendy.cloudmanic.com/subscribe method=POST accept-charset=utf-8 class="pb-3 pt-3 md:ml-8"><h1 class=m-0>Join My Newsletter</h1><p>1,000+ people have joined to following along as I share on software and bussiness.</p><input type=email name=email class="rounded-l-lg p-4 border-t mr-0 border-b border-l text-gray-800 border-gray-200 bg-white w-full md:w-2/3" placeholder=your@mail.com>
