      <div class="my-5">
<p>
  Nearly two decades ago, I embarked on my real estate journey with my first property purchase. Over the years, I've been involved in more than fifty transactions, working closely
  with real estate brokers affiliated with <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/">The National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR). My extensive experience has led me to a stark
  realization: the NAR seems to prioritize creating barriers ("moats") over fostering excellence, a practice I find deeply troubling.
</p>
<p>
  This critique is not aimed at individual Realtors or the profession at large, many of whom are exceptional and have provided invaluable insights and assistance throughout my
  ventures. My first broker, for instance, was instrumental in my education about the real estate market, dedicating numerous hours to guiding me through various deals. However,
  alongside these positive experiences, I've encountered my fair share of challenges, including interactions with unqualified and unethical agents.
</p>
<p>
  Reflecting on my two decades of experience, my encounters with brokers are mixed: half performed competently, 15% exceeded expectations with outstanding service, another 15% were
  notably poor, and the remaining 20% were frankly unethical, prioritizing commissions over integrity, costing me significantly.
</p>
<p>
  The catalyst for this discussion is a recent
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/realestate/national-association-realtors-commission-settlement.html">class action settlement</a> involving the NAR, which I hope
  signals a turning point towards meaningful reform in the real estate industry. I advocate for a shift from a system that unduly restricts buying and selling without a broker,
  effectively imposing a "tax," to one that values and rewards excellence.
</p>
<p>
  The NAR's approach of tightly controlling access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service">Multiple Listing Services</a> (MLS) and standardized forms,
  along with other restrictive practices, serves to reinforce its "moat." This contrasts starkly with models of success based on excellence, as demonstrated by companies like
  Amazon and Tesla, which have revolutionized their respective industries not by erecting barriers but by delivering unparalleled value and innovation.
</p>
<p>
  Why shouldn't the real estate industry, guided by the NAR, adopt a similar ethos? Imagine a world where Realtors are chosen for their unmatched service and expertise, where
  commissions reflect the true value delivered, and where technology and education empower clients to navigate transactions with or without agents, based on their unique needs.
</p>
<p>
  By investing in rigorous training, stringent oversight, and a pricing model that reflects the diversity of client needs and services rendered, the NAR has the opportunity to
  transform the real estate landscape. Agents could specialize in areas aligning with their skills and interests, enhancing the quality of service and client satisfaction. This
  would not render agents unnecessary but would instead valorize their role, making their expertise and assistance indispensable, much like the convenience of Amazon's shopping
  experience or the innovative allure of driving a Tesla.
</p>
<p>
  The recent settlement with the NAR presents a pivotal opportunity for change. By embracing excellence over exclusivity, the real estate industry can better serve its clients,
  rewarding integrity and value over mere transactional necessity. It's time for a shift towards a more transparent, fair, and value-driven real estate market.
