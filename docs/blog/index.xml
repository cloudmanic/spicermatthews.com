&lt;p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"&gt;
 Over the last few months, I've quietly but completely changed how I build software.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 This wasn't a single "aha" moment. It was more like a slow realization that a lot of the friction I'd accepted as normal—planning overhead, missing context, endless clicking, poorly scoped tasks—wasn't actually required anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r"&gt;
 &lt;p class="text-lg font-medium text-blue-900 m-0"&gt;
 The biggest shift? I now treat &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Issues as both my project management system and my planning document&lt;/strong&gt;, and I use &lt;strong&gt;Claude at the command line&lt;/strong&gt; as my primary collaborator to get work scoped, built, reviewed, and shipped.
 &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Remodeling My Home Proved One Thing: We Need Robots to Build Houses</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/remodeling-my-home-proved-one-thing-we-need-robots-to-build-houses/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/remodeling-my-home-proved-one-thing-we-need-robots-to-build-houses/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 When it comes to building and remodeling, I’ve always thought of myself as a hobbyist builder. Not the weekend “hang a shelf” type, but the kind of person who takes on one
 &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt;
 project every year or two. Sometimes it’s new construction from the ground up, sometimes it’s a massive remodel of one of my rental properties, and sometimes it’s a big expansion
 to my own home.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 Because I build infrequently, I have some great relationships with subcontractors and vendors—but not many. I live in this odd middle space. Some people look at me and see a
 homeowner doing his own projects. Others, who know my history, treat me more like a general contractor. I know my way around plans, bids, and building codes, but I don’t have a
 logo on my truck or a company name on my sweatshirt.
&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I Learned to Spot Inflated Bids (and What You Can Do Too)</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-spot-inflated-bids-and-what-you-can-do-too/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-spot-inflated-bids-and-what-you-can-do-too/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 For the past two decades, I've been what you might call a hobbyist builder. Every year, I take on one major construction project—sometimes a new build, sometimes a big
 renovation. Some are investment properties, others personal. These days, I've been buried in projects around my own home, but trust me—this isn't some HGTV fantasy land. It's
 more "sweat equity and YouTube tutorials" than "dream home reveal."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 Still, after years of hauling lumber and learning lessons the hard way, the place has started to look... decent. Maybe even a little too decent. And that's where things get
 tricky.
&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The AI Side Hustle Revolution: Turning Niche Ideas into Income</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/the-ai-side-hustle-revolution-turning-niche-ideas-into-income/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/the-ai-side-hustle-revolution-turning-niche-ideas-into-income/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 In early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.payrent.com/articles/2023-oregon-eviction-laws/"&gt;Oregon updated its rental laws&lt;/a&gt;, significantly complicating the eviction process for
 landlords dealing with tenants who fell behind on rent. As a property owner myself, this translated into hours lost each month manually handling and serving past-due rent
 notices. It was monotonous, repetitive, and eating away at my evenings and weekends. Clearly, a software solution was needed—but given my demanding day job, the time investment
 felt prohibitive. Until I discovered the power of AI.
&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reimagining Real Estate: A Call for Excellence Over Exclusivity</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/reimagining-real-estate-a-call-for-excellence-over-exclusivity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 12:18:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/reimagining-real-estate-a-call-for-excellence-over-exclusivity/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 Nearly two decades ago, I embarked on my real estate journey with my first property purchase. Over the years, I've been involved in more than fifty transactions, working closely
 with real estate brokers affiliated with &lt;a href="https://www.nar.realtor/"&gt;The National Association of Realtors&lt;/a&gt; (NAR). My extensive experience has led me to a stark
 realization: the NAR seems to prioritize creating barriers ("moats") over fostering excellence, a practice I find deeply troubling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 This critique is not aimed at individual Realtors or the profession at large, many of whom are exceptional and have provided invaluable insights and assistance throughout my
 ventures. My first broker, for instance, was instrumental in my education about the real estate market, dedicating numerous hours to guiding me through various deals. However,
 alongside these positive experiences, I've encountered my fair share of challenges, including interactions with unqualified and unethical agents.

 As I delve into unconventional approaches to &lt;a href="https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/"&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt;, I
 think it's worthwhile to share my thoughts on &lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/what-is-a-pull-request/"&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. While they are undoubtedly helpful,
 having another developer review your code after you've completed it, I find the traditional approach to pull requests to be somewhat cumbersome and potentially demotivating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 Throughout my years of experience, I've worked with numerous teams, each with a distinct company culture surrounding pull requests. Time and again, I've observed common issues
 such as developers not responding to pull requests promptly, leaving the original author unable to commit code. I've seen pull requests stall due to
 &lt;a href="https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/"&gt;nitpicky issues&lt;/a&gt;, and I've noticed developers rubber-stamping pull
 requests without thoroughly reviewing them simply to avoid the hassle.
&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nitpicking Code Quality: A Necessary Evil or a Harmful Habit?</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 13:18:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 I have a close friend, whom we will call Frank, who has been both a work colleague and a close friend for years. However, there are some aspects of code quality on which Frank
 and I strongly disagree. Before delving into this further, I must admit that there may be something that I am overlooking. Frank has had a long and successful career working at
 some of the top tech companies. Even to this day, he has a long list of tech companies vying for his services, while none have ever approached me :(.

 Unit testing and &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/test-driven-development"&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/a&gt; (TDD) are crucial elements of software
 development. Unit tests ensure individual code units function correctly, while TDD emphasizes writing tests before writing code to meet expected requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 As someone who enjoys TDD but dislikes writing unit tests, I appreciate the importance of testing and value an efficient development process. Unit tests should make development
 more enjoyable and not be an extra burden. They should be tools that help developers work faster, rather than additional tasks.

 Have you ever noticed that when someone drinks too much, they become predictable? They might start talking louder or acting crazier than usual. It's as if the alcohol has
 unlocked a different side of their personality. Most people are pretty steady and predictable creatures when they're sober, but when they get drunk, all bets are off. The same
 can be said for the stock market.
&lt;/p&gt;

This was a time before the Internet provided a transparent world. To get the materials I needed, at a good price I had to have good relationships and contacts. The key to good
	service and pricing was making your sales rep like you. Also, doing a lot of business with him (or her) was helpful too. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spicer's Rules on How and When To Test Your Code</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/spicers-rules-on-how-and-when-to-test-your-code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 12:18:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/spicers-rules-on-how-and-when-to-test-your-code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
	I just marked my 20th year as a professional software developer - meaning I received my first paycheck for writing code 20 years ago. I have to admit it has been a wild ride of successes, failures, crazy ideas, and immense learning. Throughout
	this journey, the topic of &lt;a href="http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/"&gt;unit tests&lt;/a&gt;, or any kind of testing for that matter, has always been front and center for me. This topic has led countless barroom debates and even more &lt;a
	 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; fights - yep, showing my age here. After some reflection, I think I have finally settled on my rules for how and when to unit test through the lens of business objectives.

&lt;p&gt;I am becoming a big fan of &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to
	build static sites like &lt;a href="https://spicermatthews.com"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.
	Since Hugo does not ship with any fancy GUI as other content management systems do -- typically you
	produce your content within your text editor such as &lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img src="https://spicermatthews.com/images/editing-hugo-post-in-atom.png" alt="Editing Hugo Post in Atom" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text editors are great but they are not ideal for producing well-thought-out written content. I like to produce my content in Google docs and then import it into Hugo. Below is a video showing how I do it. The basic
	steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Delighting Customers With Airbnb</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/delighting-customers-with-airbnb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 12:18:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/delighting-customers-with-airbnb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we launched &lt;a href="https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com"&gt;bendmountbachelorvillage.com&lt;/a&gt; for
	really no good reason. For years now, we have been using &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/smatthews18"&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; to
	rent out our vacation rental in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon"&gt;Bend, OR&lt;/a&gt;. The truth is, we designed this
	website back in 2012 when we were using &lt;a href="https://bend.craigslist.org"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; to find nightly renters.
	Before we had time to launch the site, Airbnb became a thing and changed our rental business in the best possible ways. This past weekend I decided I was sick of looking at this linger todo and I launched the site. It was already built, why not
	just get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hello World: My New Blog, Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and More</title><link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/hello-world-my-new-blog-hugo-tailwind-css-and-more/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:02:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/hello-world-my-new-blog-hugo-tailwind-css-and-more/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am launching, once again, my personal blog. Starting over. Hopefully, this is my last reboot (more on that below). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not even begin to count the number of blogs I have had in my life. Currently, I blog for &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog"&gt;Options Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://skyclerk.com/blog"&gt;Skyclerk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cloudmanic.com/blog"&gt;Cloudmanic&lt;/a&gt;.
	However, in the past, I have had all sorts of personal blogs. Just for fun here are some of my past blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621070751/http://www.spicermatthews.com/"&gt;Spicer’s Everyday Blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103185037/http://stockblog.spicermatthews.com/"&gt;Spicer’s Stock Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160328230326/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/business"&gt;Spicer’s Business Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160328223241/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/geek"&gt;Spicer’s Geek Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my blogs in the past have died for 2 reasons. Keeping up with the site updates were a headache, and many of my posts were better suited for company blogs. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
