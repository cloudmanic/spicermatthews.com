      <title>Full Circle: Back to the Terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;!--&#xA;  Date: 2026-02-19&#xA;  Copyright (c) 2026 Spicer Matthews&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p class=&#34;text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed&#34;&gt;&#xA;  I started my computer career in the late 90s. Everything happened in the terminal. I wrote bash scripts, managed servers over SSH, read my email in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_(email_client)&#34; class=&#34;text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline&#34;&gt;Pine&lt;/a&gt;, edited files in vi, and navigated the world through a blinking cursor on a black screen. That was just how you used a computer if you were a developer.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Then, over the next ~30 years, I slowly migrated away. I moved to VS Code for editing. Chrome for everything web. &lt;a href=&#34;https://superhuman.com/&#34; class=&#34;text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline&#34;&gt;Superhuman&lt;/a&gt; for email. Slack, Notion, Figma — tool after tool, each one pulling me further from the terminal and deeper into the GUI world. And it felt like progress. The tools were beautiful. The workflows were mouse-driven. The terminal became something I only opened when I absolutely had to.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Built a CLI for Massive Financial Data</title>

It&#39;s a solid API — real-time and historical market data across stocks, options, crypto, forex, futures, and indices. But every time I wanted to pull data, I was either writing throwaway scripts or wiring up an MCP server so my AI agent could fetch it for me.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was talking about how he doesn&#39;t calculate the ROI on things before doing them. He doesn&#39;t weigh the risks and rewards. He just &lt;em&gt;does stuff&lt;/em&gt; and puts it into the world.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Built a Personal AI Assistant That Lives in Slack</title>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed&#34;&gt;&#xA;  I recently spent a few hours playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://openclaw.ai/&#34; class=&#34;text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline&#34;&gt;OpenClaw&lt;/a&gt; (Clawdbot) — an autonomous AI agent you let loose on your machine. The concept is compelling: give an AI full access to your computer and let it do real work for you.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  But it does too much. It gets out of control. Their own recommendation is to run it on an isolated machine and keep it away from your personal data.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why 100 Customers at $200 Beats 1,000 at $20</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/why-100-customers-at-200-beats-1000-at-20/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/why-100-customers-at-200-beats-1000-at-20/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Here&#39;s a premise I&#39;d put money on: anyone who can build a solid product—something genuinely useful and well-executed—can attract 100 customers. It&#39;s the leap from 100 to 1,000 where founders get crushed.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I&#39;ve started multiple SaaS products. I&#39;ve helped build others. And every time, the pattern holds. The first 100 customers? Achievable. Beyond that? A grind that breaks most people.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  But lately I&#39;ve been obsessed with a different question: &lt;em&gt;what if you didn&#39;t need 1,000 customers at all?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>You Don&#39;t Lack Time. You Lack a System.</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/you-dont-lack-time-you-lack-a-system/</link>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed&#34;&gt;&#xA;  I came across a quote from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseitzler/&#34; class=&#34;text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline&#34;&gt;Jesse Itzler&lt;/a&gt; recently that stuck with me more than I expected:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p class=&#34;text-xl font-medium text-blue-900 m-0 italic&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &#34;You don&#39;t lack time. You lack a system.&#34;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p class=&#34;text-sm text-blue-700 m-0 mt-2&#34;&gt;&#xA;    — Jesse Itzler&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  At first, it sounded obvious—almost too neat. But the more I sat with it, the more I realized why it bothered me. Not because it was wrong, but because it described how I&#39;ve been living for years without ever quite putting words to it.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My New AI-First Development Workflow - Github Issues</title>

      <description>&lt;!--&#xA;  Date: 2025-12-29&#xA;  Copyright (c) 2025 Spicer Matthews&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p class=&#34;text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Over the last few months, I&#39;ve quietly but completely changed how I build software.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This wasn&#39;t a single &#34;aha&#34; moment. It was more like a slow realization that a lot of the friction I&#39;d accepted as normal—planning overhead, missing context, endless clicking, poorly scoped tasks—wasn&#39;t actually required anymore.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p class=&#34;text-lg font-medium text-blue-900 m-0&#34;&gt;&#xA;    The biggest shift? I now treat &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Issues as both my project management system and my planning document&lt;/strong&gt;, and I use &lt;strong&gt;Claude at the command line&lt;/strong&gt; as my primary collaborator to get work scoped, built, reviewed, and shipped.&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remodeling My Home Proved One Thing: We Need Robots to Build Houses</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/remodeling-my-home-proved-one-thing-we-need-robots-to-build-houses/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  When it comes to building and remodeling, I’ve always thought of myself as a hobbyist builder. Not the weekend “hang a shelf” type, but the kind of person who takes on one&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;  project every year or two. Sometimes it’s new construction from the ground up, sometimes it’s a massive remodel of one of my rental properties, and sometimes it’s a big expansion&#xA;  to my own home.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Because I build infrequently, I have some great relationships with subcontractors and vendors—but not many. I live in this odd middle space. Some people look at me and see a&#xA;  homeowner doing his own projects. Others, who know my history, treat me more like a general contractor. I know my way around plans, bids, and building codes, but I don’t have a&#xA;  logo on my truck or a company name on my sweatshirt.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Learned to Spot Inflated Bids (and What You Can Do Too)</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-spot-inflated-bids-and-what-you-can-do-too/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  For the past two decades, I&#39;ve been what you might call a hobbyist builder. Every year, I take on one major construction project—sometimes a new build, sometimes a big&#xA;  renovation. Some are investment properties, others personal. These days, I&#39;ve been buried in projects around my own home, but trust me—this isn&#39;t some HGTV fantasy land. It&#39;s&#xA;  more &#34;sweat equity and YouTube tutorials&#34; than &#34;dream home reveal.&#34;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Still, after years of hauling lumber and learning lessons the hard way, the place has started to look... decent. Maybe even a little too decent. And that&#39;s where things get&#xA;  tricky.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The AI Side Hustle Revolution: Turning Niche Ideas into Income</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/the-ai-side-hustle-revolution-turning-niche-ideas-into-income/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  In early 2023, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.payrent.com/articles/2023-oregon-eviction-laws/&#34;&gt;Oregon updated its rental laws&lt;/a&gt;, significantly complicating the eviction process for&#xA;  landlords dealing with tenants who fell behind on rent. As a property owner myself, this translated into hours lost each month manually handling and serving past-due rent&#xA;  notices. It was monotonous, repetitive, and eating away at my evenings and weekends. Clearly, a software solution was needed—but given my demanding day job, the time investment&#xA;  felt prohibitive. Until I discovered the power of AI.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reimagining Real Estate: A Call for Excellence Over Exclusivity</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/reimagining-real-estate-a-call-for-excellence-over-exclusivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 12:18:58 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/reimagining-real-estate-a-call-for-excellence-over-exclusivity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Nearly two decades ago, I embarked on my real estate journey with my first property purchase. Over the years, I&#39;ve been involved in more than fifty transactions, working closely&#xA;  with real estate brokers affiliated with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nar.realtor/&#34;&gt;The National Association of Realtors&lt;/a&gt; (NAR). My extensive experience has led me to a stark&#xA;  realization: the NAR seems to prioritize creating barriers (&#34;moats&#34;) over fostering excellence, a practice I find deeply troubling.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This critique is not aimed at individual Realtors or the profession at large, many of whom are exceptional and have provided invaluable insights and assistance throughout my&#xA;  ventures. My first broker, for instance, was instrumental in my education about the real estate market, dedicating numerous hours to guiding me through various deals. However,&#xA;  alongside these positive experiences, I&#39;ve encountered my fair share of challenges, including interactions with unqualified and unethical agents.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Streamlining Code Reviews: Maximize Efficiency and Effectiveness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  As I delve into unconventional approaches to &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/&#34;&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt;, I&#xA;  think it&#39;s worthwhile to share my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/what-is-a-pull-request/&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. While they are undoubtedly helpful,&#xA;  having another developer review your code after you&#39;ve completed it, I find the traditional approach to pull requests to be somewhat cumbersome and potentially demotivating.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Throughout my years of experience, I&#39;ve worked with numerous teams, each with a distinct company culture surrounding pull requests. Time and again, I&#39;ve observed common issues&#xA;  such as developers not responding to pull requests promptly, leaving the original author unable to commit code. I&#39;ve seen pull requests stall due to&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/&#34;&gt;nitpicky issues&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;ve noticed developers rubber-stamping pull&#xA;  requests without thoroughly reviewing them simply to avoid the hassle.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nitpicking Code Quality: A Necessary Evil or a Harmful Habit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I have a close friend, whom we will call Frank, who has been both a work colleague and a close friend for years. However, there are some aspects of code quality on which Frank&#xA;  and I strongly disagree. Before delving into this further, I must admit that there may be something that I am overlooking. Frank has had a long and successful career working at&#xA;  some of the top tech companies. Even to this day, he has a long list of tech companies vying for his services, while none have ever approached me :(.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prioritizing TDD Friendly Languages and Frameworks</title>

      <guid>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/prioritizing-tdd-friendly-languages-and-frameworks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Unit testing and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/test-driven-development&#34;&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/a&gt; (TDD) are crucial elements of software&#xA;  development. Unit tests ensure individual code units function correctly, while TDD emphasizes writing tests before writing code to meet expected requirements.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  As someone who enjoys TDD but dislikes writing unit tests, I appreciate the importance of testing and value an efficient development process. Unit tests should make development&#xA;  more enjoyable and not be an extra burden. They should be tools that help developers work faster, rather than additional tasks.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Stock Market Is a Drunken Idiot -- You Should Profit From It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Have you ever noticed that when someone drinks too much, they become predictable? They might start talking louder or acting crazier than usual. It&#39;s as if the alcohol has&#xA;  unlocked a different side of their personality. Most people are pretty steady and predictable creatures when they&#39;re sober, but when they get drunk, all bets are off. The same&#xA;  can be said for the stock market.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/images/drunk-people-dancing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Stock Market Acting Drunk&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I was a home builder before I turned computer geek. This was a time before the Internet provided a transparent world. To get the materials I needed, at a good price I had to have good relationships and contacts. The key to good&#xA;&#x9;service and pricing was making your sales rep like you. Also, doing a lot of business with him (or her) was helpful too. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spicer&#39;s Rules on How and When To Test Your Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#x9;I just marked my 20th year as a professional software developer - meaning I received my first paycheck for writing code 20 years ago. I have to admit it has been a wild ride of successes, failures, crazy ideas, and immense learning. Throughout&#xA;&#x9;this journey, the topic of &lt;a href=&#34;http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/&#34;&gt;unit tests&lt;/a&gt;, or any kind of testing for that matter, has always been front and center for me. This topic has led countless barroom debates and even more &lt;a&#xA;&#x9; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&#34;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; fights - yep, showing my age here. After some reflection, I think I have finally settled on my rules for how and when to unit test through the lens of business objectives.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Hugo with Google Docs</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick tip alert!&lt;/b&gt; This is how I import Google docs into Hugo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am becoming a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to&#xA;&#x9;build static sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#x9;Since Hugo does not ship with any fancy GUI as other content management systems do -- typically you&#xA;&#x9;produce your content within your text editor such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io&#34;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;img src=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/images/editing-hugo-post-in-atom.png&#34; alt=&#34;Editing Hugo Post in Atom&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Text editors are great but they are not ideal for producing well-thought-out written content. I like to produce my content in Google docs and then import it into Hugo. Below is a video showing how I do it. The basic&#xA;&#x9;steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com&#34;&gt;bendmountbachelorvillage.com&lt;/a&gt; for&#xA;&#x9;really no good reason. For years now, we have been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/smatthews18&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; to&#xA;&#x9;rent out our vacation rental in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon&#34;&gt;Bend, OR&lt;/a&gt;. The truth is, we designed this&#xA;&#x9;website back in 2012 when we were using &lt;a href=&#34;https://bend.craigslist.org&#34;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; to find nightly renters.&#xA;&#x9;Before we had time to launch the site, Airbnb became a thing and changed our rental business in the best possible ways. This past weekend I decided I was sick of looking at this linger todo and I launched the site. It was already built, why not&#xA;&#x9;just get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am launching, once again, my personal blog. Starting over. Hopefully, this is my last reboot (more on that below). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could not even begin to count the number of blogs I have had in my life. Currently, I blog for &lt;a href=&#34;https://options.cafe/blog&#34;&gt;Options Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://skyclerk.com/blog&#34;&gt;Skyclerk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudmanic.com/blog&#34;&gt;Cloudmanic&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#x9;However, in the past, I have had all sorts of personal blogs. Just for fun here are some of my past blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110621070751/http://www.spicermatthews.com/&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Everyday Blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100103185037/http://stockblog.spicermatthews.com/&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Stock Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328230326/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/business&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Business Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328223241/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/geek&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Geek Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328215117/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/personal&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Personal Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All my blogs in the past have died for 2 reasons. Keeping up with the site updates were a headache, and many of my posts were better suited for company blogs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
