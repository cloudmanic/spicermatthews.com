      <title>The AI Side Hustle Revolution: Turning Niche Ideas into Income</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.payrent.com/articles/2023-oregon-eviction-laws/&#34;&gt;Oregon updated its rental laws&lt;/a&gt;, significantly complicating the eviction process for landlords dealing with tenants who fell behind on rent. As a property owner myself, this translated into hours lost each month manually handling and serving past-due rent notices. It was monotonous, repetitive, and eating away at my evenings and weekends. Clearly, a software solution was needed—but given my demanding day job, the time investment felt prohibitive. Until I discovered the power of AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reimagining Real Estate: A Call for Excellence Over Exclusivity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Nearly two decades ago, I embarked on my real estate journey with my first property purchase. Over the years, I&#39;ve been involved in more than fifty transactions, working closely&#xA;  with real estate brokers affiliated with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nar.realtor/&#34;&gt;The National Association of Realtors&lt;/a&gt; (NAR). My extensive experience has led me to a stark&#xA;  realization: the NAR seems to prioritize creating barriers (&#34;moats&#34;) over fostering excellence, a practice I find deeply troubling.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This critique is not aimed at individual Realtors or the profession at large, many of whom are exceptional and have provided invaluable insights and assistance throughout my&#xA;  ventures. My first broker, for instance, was instrumental in my education about the real estate market, dedicating numerous hours to guiding me through various deals. However,&#xA;  alongside these positive experiences, I&#39;ve encountered my fair share of challenges, including interactions with unqualified and unethical agents.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Streamlining Code Reviews: Maximize Efficiency and Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/streamlining-code-reviews-maximize-efficiency-and-effectiveness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  As I delve into unconventional approaches to &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/&#34;&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt;, I&#xA;  think it&#39;s worthwhile to share my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/what-is-a-pull-request/&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. While they are undoubtedly helpful,&#xA;  having another developer review your code after you&#39;ve completed it, I find the traditional approach to pull requests to be somewhat cumbersome and potentially demotivating.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Throughout my years of experience, I&#39;ve worked with numerous teams, each with a distinct company culture surrounding pull requests. Time and again, I&#39;ve observed common issues&#xA;  such as developers not responding to pull requests promptly, leaving the original author unable to commit code. I&#39;ve seen pull requests stall due to&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/blog/nitpicking-code-quality-a-necessary-evil-or-a-harmful-habit/&#34;&gt;nitpicky issues&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;ve noticed developers rubber-stamping pull&#xA;  requests without thoroughly reviewing them simply to avoid the hassle.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nitpicking Code Quality: A Necessary Evil or a Harmful Habit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I have a close friend, whom we will call Frank, who has been both a work colleague and a close friend for years. However, there are some aspects of code quality on which Frank&#xA;  and I strongly disagree. Before delving into this further, I must admit that there may be something that I am overlooking. Frank has had a long and successful career working at&#xA;  some of the top tech companies. Even to this day, he has a long list of tech companies vying for his services, while none have ever approached me :(.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prioritizing TDD Friendly Languages and Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://spicermatthews.com/blog/prioritizing-tdd-friendly-languages-and-frameworks/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Unit testing and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/test-driven-development&#34;&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/a&gt; (TDD) are crucial elements of software&#xA;  development. Unit tests ensure individual code units function correctly, while TDD emphasizes writing tests before writing code to meet expected requirements.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  As someone who enjoys TDD but dislikes writing unit tests, I appreciate the importance of testing and value an efficient development process. Unit tests should make development&#xA;  more enjoyable and not be an extra burden. They should be tools that help developers work faster, rather than additional tasks.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Stock Market Is a Drunken Idiot -- You Should Profit From It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Have you ever noticed that when someone drinks too much, they become predictable? They might start talking louder or acting crazier than usual. It&#39;s as if the alcohol has&#xA;  unlocked a different side of their personality. Most people are pretty steady and predictable creatures when they&#39;re sober, but when they get drunk, all bets are off. The same&#xA;  can be said for the stock market.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/images/drunk-people-dancing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Stock Market Acting Drunk&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Am Over Vendors That Are Not Transparent in Pricing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I was a home builder before I turned computer geek. This was a time before the Internet provided a transparent world. To get the materials I needed, at a good price I had to have good relationships and contacts. The key to good&#xA;&#x9;service and pricing was making your sales rep like you. Also, doing a lot of business with him (or her) was helpful too. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spicer&#39;s Rules on How and When To Test Your Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#x9;I just marked my 20th year as a professional software developer - meaning I received my first paycheck for writing code 20 years ago. I have to admit it has been a wild ride of successes, failures, crazy ideas, and immense learning. Throughout&#xA;&#x9;this journey, the topic of &lt;a href=&#34;http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/&#34;&gt;unit tests&lt;/a&gt;, or any kind of testing for that matter, has always been front and center for me. This topic has led countless barroom debates and even more &lt;a&#xA;&#x9; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&#34;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; fights - yep, showing my age here. After some reflection, I think I have finally settled on my rules for how and when to unit test through the lens of business objectives.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Hugo with Google Docs</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick tip alert!&lt;/b&gt; This is how I import Google docs into Hugo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am becoming a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to&#xA;&#x9;build static sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#x9;Since Hugo does not ship with any fancy GUI as other content management systems do -- typically you&#xA;&#x9;produce your content within your text editor such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io&#34;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;img src=&#34;https://spicermatthews.com/images/editing-hugo-post-in-atom.png&#34; alt=&#34;Editing Hugo Post in Atom&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Text editors are great but they are not ideal for producing well-thought-out written content. I like to produce my content in Google docs and then import it into Hugo. Below is a video showing how I do it. The basic&#xA;&#x9;steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Delighting Customers With Airbnb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://bendmountbachelorvillage.com&#34;&gt;bendmountbachelorvillage.com&lt;/a&gt; for&#xA;&#x9;really no good reason. For years now, we have been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/smatthews18&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; to&#xA;&#x9;rent out our vacation rental in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon&#34;&gt;Bend, OR&lt;/a&gt;. The truth is, we designed this&#xA;&#x9;website back in 2012 when we were using &lt;a href=&#34;https://bend.craigslist.org&#34;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; to find nightly renters.&#xA;&#x9;Before we had time to launch the site, Airbnb became a thing and changed our rental business in the best possible ways. This past weekend I decided I was sick of looking at this linger todo and I launched the site. It was already built, why not&#xA;&#x9;just get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am launching, once again, my personal blog. Starting over. Hopefully, this is my last reboot (more on that below). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could not even begin to count the number of blogs I have had in my life. Currently, I blog for &lt;a href=&#34;https://options.cafe/blog&#34;&gt;Options Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://skyclerk.com/blog&#34;&gt;Skyclerk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudmanic.com/blog&#34;&gt;Cloudmanic&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#x9;However, in the past, I have had all sorts of personal blogs. Just for fun here are some of my past blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110621070751/http://www.spicermatthews.com/&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Everyday Blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100103185037/http://stockblog.spicermatthews.com/&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Stock Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328230326/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/business&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Business Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328223241/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/geek&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Geek Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160328215117/http://spicermatthews.com/blogs/personal&#34;&gt;Spicer’s Personal Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All my blogs in the past have died for 2 reasons. Keeping up with the site updates were a headache, and many of my posts were better suited for company blogs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
